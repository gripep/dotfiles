# Dotfiles

This is a collection of useful functions, aliases, git config for an easy setup of a new machine.

## Install

My OS of choice is macOS.

At the moment, [macOS](#macos) is the only config available.

### macOS

> **Requirements:** Apple Silicon (M1 or newer). The install scripts assume
> Homebrew under `/opt/homebrew` and will exit on Intel Macs.

Before you start:

- Sign in to the App Store (required for `mas` to install Mac App Store apps).
- Some App Store apps (e.g. Magnet) must already be purchased with your Apple ID,
  otherwise the Homebrew bundle step will fail on them.

1. Ensure your system is up to date:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

And finally

- Connect your mouse and keyboard
- Log-in into the AppStore

2. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gripep/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

3. Create and update the dotfiles `.env` file:

```bash
# Copy the `.env.example` content to a `.env` file
# Then update the `.env` file with your information
cp ~/.dotfiles/system/.env.example ~/.dotfiles/system/.env
```

N.B.
You might have to log-in into your GitHub account to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable.

4. Run the installation script:

```bash
source ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

5. Update the Dock and System Settings:

Once installation is complete, the `dotfiles` CLI is available in your shell.  
Run `dotfiles --help` to see all available commands.

To get started, run:

```bash
dotfiles macos
dotfiles update # This will take a while
```

N.B.
Most of the configuration files will live under the `.config/` directory.

```bash
.config
├── ...
└── zsh
```

Everything development-related will live under the `Developer/` directory. Inside, there will be a Linux-style structure to keep things tidy, e.g. `bin/`, `opt/`, `src/`, `tmp/`, etc.

```bash
Developer
├── bin  # for exec files, etc.
├── opt  # for optional installations, e.g. go, etc.
├── src  # for projects
├── ...
└── tmp  # for any temp or throwaway stuff
```

The `.env` file is intentionally **not** sourced by the interactive shell, so secrets (e.g. `GITHUB_TOKEN`) are not leaked into every shell session. Run `loadenv` when you actually need those variables.

> **TODO:** Consider splitting personal, non-secret info I want to inject into commands (e.g. `$EMAIL`) into a separate file that _is_ sourced on shell startup, keeping secrets in `.env` behind `loadenv`.

For ad-hoc aliases, commands, and other tweaks, use the `/system/.custom` file and add them there. The zsh config loads it automatically, and git ignores the file.

The `~/Developer/bin` directory is also added to your PATH automatically.

Run the `clean.sh` script to remove personal files and configuration from your machine. Read the file comments to find out more.
